Some properties of the simulation:
Density,     min = 5.4e-25,	 max = 2.6e-17
Temperature, min = 4.8,		 max = 1.3e+04
ndens H,     min = 0.16,	 max = 7.9e+06
ndens e,     min = 2.5e-05,	 max = 0.37
e fraction,  min = 3.1e-12,	 max = 0.015
Rad. Field G min = 0.015,	 max = inf
I'm looking for a grain size smaller than 10 Angstrom. Outside the tabulated data!!!
Extrapolating is kinda not working so taking the Qabs, a=10 AA
